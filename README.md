## Features

- __extremely simple__: the API exposes _one function_!
- __easy to understand__: only ~200 SLOC!
- __very modern__: works very well with async functions (node 7.6+)
- __extendable as h*ck__: provides hooking mechanisms to serve your every need

## Installation

You need Node.js __7.6__ or higher.

```sh
npm install --save @weh/weh
```

## Example

Let's write a simple program that changes the content of all files in a
directory to "hey, what's up":

```js
const weh = require('@weh/weh')

// this is this simplest plugin you can build!
// conveniently, plugins are just normal functions
const plugin = () => {
  return files => {
    // replace all file contents with the string
    return files.map(file => Object.assign(file, {contents: 'hey, what\'s up'}))
  }
}

// enter our main function:
// the main function should be an async function so that
// it automatically returns a promise
weh(async site => {
  // we register our plugin...
  site.use(plugin)
  // ...and initiate the build process
  return site
})
```

That's 8 lines of code!

Let's save this as `example.js`. To run it, you need Node.js version 7.6 or
higher. The latest stable version will work.

```sh
node example.js
```

`weh` outputs logs in _JSON formatting_ by default. If you want nice and cute
logs, I recommend using [pino-colada](http://npm.im/pino-colada):

```sh
npm i -g pino-colada

# pipe the script output into pino-colada
node example.js | pino-colada
```

## How does it work?

It's fairly simple! What `weh` does can be split up into two things:

- First, it reads a directory and saves all of the information about each file
  into a gigantic object. That object can be manipulated by _plugins_, which
  makes `weh` actually do things.
- After most plugins are run, `weh` writes the files as they are described
  in the gigantic object to disk.

It's that simple! Static site generators aren't rocket science or whatever.
If you got confused by looking at the Jekyll source code once, that's because
Jekyll is more fully fledged than `weh` is, that is, it provides some defaults.

But static site generators, at their core, are just programs that take a set of
files, do something to them, and then output those files. That's it. The rest is just _transformations_ on those files.

`weh`'s goal is to reduce that essence to its very base, and to give you a
bunch of building blocks with which you can make your ideal site, using only
the stuff you need!

## API Documentation

See [API.md](https://github.com/wehjs/weh/blob/master/API.md).

## Development Setup

In the case that you want to work on `weh` itself, you're gonna need to clone
this repository first:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wehjs/weh
```

To install all of the development dependencies required for testing and such,
you can just run `npm install`.

## How does it compare?

This section is a little bit about how `weh` compares to other static site
generators (even though it isn't really that):

- __jekyll__: Jekyll is a whole lot different. First off, it provides a whole
  lot of defaults (such as YAML Front-Matter, the Liquid language, etc) to
  help you build your static site extremely quickly. It's also massively
  geared for security, since it runs on GitHub's Pages platform. Stuff like
  custom plugins isn't even available there (not like that's a bad thing!).
- __ghost__: Ghost is just straight up a blogging platform. I don't even know
  why it's on AlternativeTo.
- __hugo__: Hugo, a bit like Jekyll, has predefined concepts like "pages" and
  "tags". It's also way more stable and faster than `weh`. Why am I still writing this?
- __metalsmith__: Metalsmith is probably the thing that's most like `weh`, and
  as a matter of fact, its main inspiration. It's also plugin-based, and works
  with roughly the same concepts. The major difference is that `weh` is more
  up-to-date (I like promises a lot) and that the API is fairly different.
  Also, it's just not really an active project with an active ecosystem
  anymore (sadly!).

## What dependencies does it have?

- [`deepmerge`](http://npm.im/deepmerge) - used to handle configuration management
- [`walk`](http://npm.im/walk) - walks through directories to read them
- [`trough`](http://npm.im/trough) - handles middleware chains
- [`write-file-promise`](http://npm.im/write-file-promise) and
  [`fs-readfile-promise`](http://npm.im/fs-readfile-promise) - promise-based
  versions of the standard `fs` methods
- [`pino`](http://npm.im/pino) - used for logging
- [`lodash.flatten`](http://npm.im/lodash.flatten) - normalizes plugin arrays
- [`excluded`](http://npm.im/excluded) - handles path exclusion logic
- [`is-text-path`](http://npm.im/is-text-path) - provides logic to correctly read binary files

If you have any ideas as to how to eliminate a dependency, you're more than
welcome to pitch it here!
